**Final Project Proposal: Enhancing Quantitative Trading Strategies Using Transformer-Based Models**  
*(Google Docs Format)*  

---

### **1. Subject**  
We aim to explore the application of transformer-based models in quantitative trading by replicating and extending the **Quantformer** architecture from the paper. Our focus is to adapt this model to predict stock returns using numerical financial data, with validation on the **U.S. stock market** (e.g., S&P 500 constituents) to assess its generalizability across markets.

### **2. Data Collection**  
#### **Datasets**  
- **Historical Stock Data**  
  - **Scope**: Daily, weekly, and monthly adjusted closing prices, turnover rates, and trading volumes for U.S. stocks (e.g., S&P 500) from 2010–2023.  
  - **Sources**: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or QuantConnect.  
- **Benchmark Data**  
  - S&P 500 index data for calculating excess returns and risk-adjusted metrics.  

#### **Preprocessing**  
- Handle missing values (e.g., delisted or suspended stocks).  
- Normalize features using zero-mean, unit-variance normalization.  
- Segment data into training (2010–2019) and testing (2020–2023) periods.

### **3. Methods**  
#### **Model Architecture**  
- Implement **Quantformer** using PyTorch:  
  - Replace word embeddings with linear layers.  
  - Simplify the decoder for regression/classification tasks.  
  - Train with multi-head self-attention, MSE loss, and Adam optimizer.  

#### **Baselines for Comparison**  
- Traditional models: LSTM, GRU.  
- Classical quantitative factors: Momentum, moving averages.  

#### **Experiments**  
- Test performance across data frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly).  
- Evaluate scalability by varying quantiles (e.g., top 1%, 5%, 10% of stocks).  

#### **Backtesting**  
- Simulate trading strategies using model predictions (buy/hold/sell signals).  
- Evaluate using risk-adjusted metrics:  
  - **Sharpe Ratio**, **Alpha**, **VaR**, **Maximum Drawdown**.  

---

### **4. Goals**  
#### **Primary Objectives**  
- Replicate the Quantformer model and validate its predictive accuracy on U.S. market data.  
- Achieve superior risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio > 1.0, positive Alpha) compared to benchmarks like the S&P 500.  

#### **Secondary Objectives**  
- Investigate the impact of training frequency (daily vs. monthly) and dataset scale on performance.  
- Publish open-source code and results on GitHub for reproducibility.  

#### **Stretch Goal**  
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., news sentiment, macroeconomic indicators) to enhance predictions.  

---

### **5. Expected Outcome**  
- A robust transformer-based trading strategy demonstrating Quantformer’s viability in diverse markets.  
- Open-source code, detailed performance analysis, and a comparative study against traditional models/factors.
